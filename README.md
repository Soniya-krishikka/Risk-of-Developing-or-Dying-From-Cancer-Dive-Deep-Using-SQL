## Introduction

Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Understanding the risk factors and trends in cancer development and mortality can aid in better prevention and treatment strategies. This project utilizes SQL to perform an in-depth analysis of cancer data, providing valuable insights into the epidemiology of cancer.

## Project Objectives

1. To analyze trends in cancer incidence and mortality.
2. To identify significant risk factors associated with developing or dying from cancer.
3. To provide data-driven insights to aid in cancer prevention and treatment strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes comprehensive cancer statistics, such as incidence rates, mortality rates, demographic information, and other relevant factors. The data is sourced from reliable cancer registries and health organizations.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: For data extraction, manipulation, and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data exploration and analysis.
- **Python**: For additional data processing and visualization.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook with SQL queries and analysis.
- `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for data processing and visualization.
- `results/`: Contains the output of the analysis, including charts and reports.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Key Findings

- [Summary of key findings will be added here after completing the analysis.]

## Limitations

- The dataset may have limitations in terms of completeness and accuracy.
- The analysis is limited to the variables available in the dataset.
- The findings may not be generalizable to all populations due to potential biases in the data.
